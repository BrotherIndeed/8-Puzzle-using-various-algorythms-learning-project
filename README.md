# 8-Puzzle-using-various-algorythms-learning-project
8 puzzle comprehensive techniques, learning project  PUZZLE AI  
This is a project dedicated to learning AI search algorithms with the example of the famous 8 puzzle the puzzle consists of a 3 * 3 matrix which has 0 to 8 digits 
The zero switches places with the digit to its right, left, up or down and keeps on doing so till the desired matrix is achieved.  
The aim is to use all the search algorithms taught in the AI course (UCS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS)  
Target algorithms include :-                                                            
Forward and backward                                                          
state-space search algorithm                                                                    
blind search algorithm                                                        
heuristic search algorithm                                                              
problem-reduction search algorithm                                                      
A search algorithm 
A* search algorithm 
AO* search algorithm 
minimax search algorithm 
constraint propagation search algorithm 
stochastic search algorithm 
evolutionary search algorithm
  
  These algorythms will be used to solve more complex puzzles and to deepen my understanding.
