# 8-Puzzle-using-various-algorythms-learning-project
8 puzzle comprehensive techniques, learning project 
This is a project dedicated to learning AI search algorithms with the example of the famous 8 puzzle the puzzle consists of a 3 * 3 matrix which has 0 to 8 digits 
The zero switches places with the digit to its right, left, up or down and keeps on doing so till the desired matrix is achieved.  
The aim is to use all the search algorithms taught in the AI course (UCS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS).

Target algorithms include :-          
1  Forward and backward                                                          
2  state-space search algorithm                                                                    
3  blind search algorithm                                                        
4  heuristic search algorithm
